abstract = {Conservation aims to preserve species and ecosystem services. If rare species contribute little to ecosystem services, yet are those most in need of preservation, tradeoffs may exist for these contrasting objectives. However, little attention has focused on identifying how, when, and where rare species contribute to ecosystem services and at what scales. Here, we review distinct ways that ecosystem services can positively depend on the presence, abundance, disproportionate contribution or, counterintuitively, the scarcity of rare species. By contrast, ecosystem services are less likely to depend on rare species that do not have a unique role in any service or become abundant enough to contribute substantially. We propose a research agenda to identify when rare species may contribute significantly to services.},

@article{Oliveira-Filho1995a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The floristic nature of central Brazilian forests, as well as their links to other main forest formations of eastern tropical South America, is assessed by means of multivariate analyses of 106 existing floristic checklists and by the analysis of a series of dot-maps showing the distribution of 55 woody species. Most species of central Brazilian forests seem to conform to two main distribution patterns: (1) species of deciduous and semideciduous forests are dependent essentially on the occurrence of patches of soils of intermediate to high fertility within the cerrado domain and tend to be distributed mostly along a northeast-southwest arch connecting the caatingas to the chaco boundaries; (2) considerable numbers of gallery forest species are dependent on high soil moisture and many appear to link the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests by crossing the cerrado region in a northwest-southeast route via the dendritic net of gallery forests. Many gallery forest species are habitat generalists, some even occurring in the cerrado vegetation. Nevertheless, significant numbers of gallery endemics are also present. Galleries of the west and north of the Cerrado Province show stronger floristic links to the Amazonian rainforests, while those of the centre and south show stronger affinity with the montane semideciduous forests of southeastern Brazil. Present-day distribution patterns are discussed in the light of the current knowledge of palaeoenvironmental changes in the Neotropics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Biological invasions present a global problem underlain by an ecological paradox that thwarts explanation: how do some exotic species, evolutionarily na{\"{i}}ve to their new environments, outperform locally adapted natives? We propose that community assembly theory provides a framework for addressing this question. Local community assembly rules can be defined by evaluating how native species' traits interact with community filters to affect species abundance. Evaluation of exotic species against this benchmark indicates that exotics that follow assembly rules behave like natives, while those exhibiting novel interactions with community filters can greatly underperform or outperform natives. Additionally, advantages gained by exotics over natives following disturbance can be explained by accounting for extrinsic assembly processes that bias exotic traits toward ruderal strategies.},
